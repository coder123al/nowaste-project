# Food Waste in NYC - Data Science Project

~Food waste is very prevelant within the United States, and we wanted to look at how common it was. We decided to use the nation's largest city to understand/analyze any trends or correlations that may exist. 

~Motivation for this project was to analyze and illustrate trends between neighborhood profile demographics and their respective food scrap centers within NYC and its boroughs. 

~Project uses publically accessible opensource datasets to best illustrate waste with NYC through using Plotly. 

~Languages used: HTML, CSS, Python, JavaScript
